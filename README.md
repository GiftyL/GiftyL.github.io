## **Inspiration**
For this project I wanted to design a website that uses an API. I wanted to design my first website to test and challenge myself. With available time that was given for this project i choose to do a simple weather website.

## **How to use the website**
When you first open the website it asks you to grant it your location permission.If you do so, it it will automatically shows you the weather information of the city you are in.But if you dont wat to grant your permission you can search the weather information of any city in the world.
